🎲 Game Concept

The game is for 2 players, playing online.

Each player starts with 6 number cards from 1 to 6 (like UNO number cards, no special cards).

Players take turns rolling a dice (1–6).

When a dice is rolled, the player can remove cards from their hand if they match the dice roll or sum to the dice roll.

If no valid combination exists, the player draws a card from the deck.

The first player to remove all their cards wins.
